## About Me

Myself Mehulkumar Rajkumar Lakhadive (just call me Mehul), I am a dedicated and passionate Civil Engineering student pursuing an Integrated Dual Degree from IIT BHU. In my journey, I have actively engaged in research and projects that focus on enhancing structural analysis and health monitoring techniques. Through these experiences, I have not only honed my technical skills but also developed a deep fascination for the field.
In extracurricular I spent my time on the ground as I am an athlete(400m sprint), I also sing and listen to different genres of music, Pop and Indie Pop being my favourtie.

## Projects

### 	Smooth Orthogonal Decomposition for Advanced Structural Health Monitoring: 

Worked as an exploratory project student under the guidance of Assistant Professor [Dr. Basuraj Bhowmik]([[url]([https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/civ/people/basurajciv])])


ðŸ“… Duration:  January 23- June 23

Description:

- Developed an algorithm using Smooth Orthogonal Decomposition to identify modes of dynamic structures.
- This approach enabled the detection of structural damage and pinpointed its location with remarkable accuracy.
- Worked on a 5 DOF system and modal analysis of which helped in the detection of damage.
- This research cultivated a profound appreciation for structural health monitoring, highlighting the synergy between computational techniques and engineering principles

### DAMAGE DETECTION OF BURIED PIPELINE USING PCA

A novel research project under Assistant Professor [Dr. Basuraj Bhowmik]([[url]([https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/civ/people/basurajciv])])


ðŸ“… Duration:  June 23-Present

Description:

- Worked on a project that addressed a critical issue in infrastructure management â€“ fault detection in underground pipeline systems.
- Extracted vital insights from a large dataset containing voltage vs. time profiles of both intact and damaged pipes.
- Applyed PCA and pioneering graphical analysis methods, we not only detected faults but also accurately determined the location and extent of leaks.
- Principle Component Analysis(PCA), Signal Processing, Matlab, Graphical Analysis, Teamwork, Microsoft Excel.
- The final results quantify damage in the pipe based on the EigenVariance Index (EVI), predict the exact location of damage, also works efficiently with SNR values below 2, proving its robustness to noise.
